# This is to keep track of the various package and dependency installs done while developing the project

node -v
npm -v
yarn -v
#creates package.json
npm init -y

# to get typescript and node to behave with each other
# set up dependency using
yarn add -D @types/node typescript
# this gives you access to the type information for all node built-in functions

#in package.json, add a new script
# "scripts":
#   "start":"ts-node server/src/index.ts"

# to install that:
yarn add -D ts-node

#before running index.ts, you need to set up a config for typescript
# you can download the boilerplate typescript configuration file using
# npx tsconfig.json
# it prompts which framework, answer 'node'

#in package.json, add these new scripts
#  "scripts": {
#    "watch": "tsc -w",
#    "dev": "nodemon dist/index.js",
#    "start": "node dist/index.js",
#    "start2": "ts-node server/src/index.ts",
#    "dev2": "nodemon --exec ts-node server/src/index.ts"

#    Starts the development server.

#  yarn build
#    Builds the app for production.

#  yarn start
#    Runs the built app in production mode.

responses to the wizard:
What type of application are you building?
(default) Application built with React
Where is your schema?: (path or url) (http://localhost:4000)
 http://localhost:4000/graphql
Where are your operations and fragments?: (src/**/*.graphql)
src/graphql/**/*.graphql
Pick plugins: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
TypeScript React Apollo (typed components and HOCs)
Where to write the output: (src/generated/graphql.tsx)
keep the default, and create the folder just in case it doesn't generate it itself
Do you want to generate an introspection file? (Y/n) n
How to name the config file? (codegen.yml)
codegen.yaml
What script in package.json should run the codegen?
gen

Based on the responses, the wizard above will create codegen.yaml
NOW EDIT that file, replace
      - "typescript-react-apollo"
with
      - "typescript-urql"
MAKE THE CORRESPONDING change in package.json, remove under "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo": "2.0.7",

#install the plugin, see http://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/installation
#  do a search on this site for 'urql'
#  pick typescript-urql, which brings you to
#                http://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/generated-config/typescript.urql
# the command found there to execute is:
yarn add -D graphql-codegen/typescript-urql

#create these folders:
web/src/generated
web/src/graphql/mutations
web/src/graphql/queries

# whenever you create/edit a .graphql file, run in a terminal window:
yarn gen
#which creates/maintains file generated/graphql.tsx

## subscription support
On Server folder:
yarn add graphql-subscriptions
yarn add graphql-composer

## websocket support
